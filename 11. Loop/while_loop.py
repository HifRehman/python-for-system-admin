Infinity loop

While loop in python is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the test expression (condition) is true.

We generally use this loop when we don't know beforehand, the number of times to iterate.

while True:
    print("Welcome to Forever")
'''
# import time
# while True:
#     print("Monitoring file system usage")
#     time.sleep(1)

# value = 4
# while value<=6785:
#     print(value)
#     value=value+456

count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print("hello")
    count=count+1
