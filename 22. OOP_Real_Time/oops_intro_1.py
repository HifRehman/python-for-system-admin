It is about: Class, Object, Inheritence, Polimorphism, Data Abstraction and Data Encapsulation.

For starting POV it is about Class and Objects

Object could be anything which exists in real-time, like human, fan, car,email,any application,jenkins, docker,tomcat etc

Each object has characteristics and functions.

Human:
 - characteristics : name, age
 - Functions : walking, talking and running

Why OOP's
----------
- To group related functions(methods)
- To create a template/blueprint
- Template is nothing but a class in oops concept

- OOP's is a concept where characteristic and functions of a real life object is packaged as a single
  entity in the code.

 Writing your code in term of block is object
